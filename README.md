# Presentation

It's a fullstack news web app created using Golang & Gin & Gorm & Bulma.

You can check this project running at AWS here: "http://44.212.43.124:3001/".

This app shares the same database of this Nextjs + Nestjs Web Application, found here:"http://44.212.43.124"

As they share the same tables at database, the categories and news related are the same. You can compare'em. :)

See you, yours Ian
